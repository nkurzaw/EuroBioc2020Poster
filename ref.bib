abstract = {The thermal stability of proteins can be used to assess ligand binding in living cells. We have generalized this concept by determining the thermal profiles of more than 7000 proteins in human cells by means of mass spectrometry. Monitoring the effects of small-molecule ligands on the profiles delineated more than 50 targets for the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase as a target of kinase inhibitors and suggest that its inhibition causes the phototoxicity observed with vemurafenib and alectinib. Thermal shifts were also observed for downstream effectors of drug treatment. In live cells, dasatinib induced shifts in {BCR}-{ABL} pathway proteins, including {CRK}/{CRKL}. Thermal proteome profiling provides an unbiased measure of drug-target engagement and facilitates identification of markers for drug efficacy and toxicity.

abstract = {We describe a two-dimensional thermal proteome profiling strategy that can be combined with an orthogonal chemoproteomics approach to enable comprehensive target profiling of the marketed histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The N-hydroxycinnamide moiety is identified as critical for potent and tetrahydrobiopterin-competitive inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to increases in phenylalanine and decreases in tyrosine levels. These findings provide a rationale for adverse clinical observations and suggest repurposing of the drug for treatment of tyrosinemia.}

abstract = {The direct detection of drug-protein interactions in living cells is a major challenge in drug discovery research. Recently, we introduced an approach termed thermal proteome profiling ({TPP}), which enables the monitoring of changes in protein thermal stability across the proteome using quantitative mass spectrometry. We determined the intracellular thermal profiles for up to 7,000 proteins, and by comparing profiles derived from cultured mammalian cells in the presence or absence of a drug we showed that it was possible to identify direct and indirect targets of drugs in living cells in an unbiased manner. Here we demonstrate the complete workflow using the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The key to this approach is the use of isobaric tandem mass tag 10-plex ({TMT10}) reagents to label digested protein samples corresponding to each temperature point in the melting curve so that the samples can be analyzed by multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. Important steps in the bioinformatic analysis include data normalization, melting curve fitting and statistical significance determination of compound concentration-dependent changes in protein stability. All analysis tools are made freely available as R and Python packages. The workflow can be completed in 2 weeks.}

abstract = {Detecting the targets of drugs and other molecules in intact cellular contexts is a major objective in drug discovery and in biology more broadly. Thermal proteome profiling ({TPP}) pursues this aim at proteome-wide scale by inferring target engagement from its effects on temperature-dependent protein denaturation. However, a key challenge of {TPP} is the statistical analysis of the measured melting curves with controlled false discovery rates at high proteome coverage and detection power. We present non-parametric analysis of response curves ({NPARC}), a statistical method for {TPP} based on functional data analysis and nonlinear regression. We evaluate {NPARC} on five independent {TPP} datasets and observe that it is able to detect subtle changes in any region of the melting curves, reliably detects the known targets, and outperforms a melting point-centric, single-parameter fitting approach in terms of specificity and sensitivity. {NPARC} can be combined with established analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) statistics and enables flexible, factorial experimental designs and replication levels. To facilitate access to a wide range of users, a freely available software implementation of {NPARC} is provided.

abstract = {Detecting ligand-protein interactions in living cells is a fundamental challenge in molecular biology and drug research. Proteome-wide profiling of thermal stability as a function of ligand concentration promises to tackle this challenge. However, current data analysis strategies use preset thresholds that can lead to suboptimal sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs and limited comparability across datasets. Here, we present a method based on statistical hypothesis testing on curves, which provides control of the false discovery rate. We apply it to several datasets probing epigenetic drugs and a metabolite. This leads us to detect off-target drug engagement, including the finding that the {HDAC8} inhibitor {PCI}-34051 and its analog {BRD}-3811 bind to and inhibit leucine aminopeptidase 3. An implementation is available as an R package from Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/{TPP2D} ). We hope that our method will facilitate prioritizing targets from thermal profiling experiments.}
